# Overview

The goal of this project was to create a project just with vinella javascript. I have created web apps in the past with react, but I felt like learning how javascipt works on its own would help me be able to understand the benifits of react.

The software that I wrote is a uno game called mathuno. If you would like to play a live version of it go to 
https://mathuno.com/

I made this software to learn how to make a multiplayer game. Its purpose is to provide entertainment to users.

# Web Pages
Techinically this is a one page app, but I did create multiple popups:
- Loading Screen - Hides everything and loads the images
- Begining Menu - Allows the player to join or host a game
- End Menu - Declares a winner
- Color Menu - Allows the player to pick a color

The following elements are dynamic:
- Player Cards
- Player Decks
- Player Decks Numbers
- GameID
- Player Names
- End Screen Name
- Start Button
- Winning Crown
- Leave Game Button

# Development Environment

I used javascript, html, and css for this project. I didn't use any libraries other than firebase.

# Useful Websites

All the code provided was my own. I didn't use any tutorials. I did get a little help from W3Schools, online forms, and ChatGPT when I got stuck. 

Other than that this project was all me trying to figure out how to solve each problem on my own.
# Future Work

The following is my current update list:
- Add Uno button

- Host shows 0 Cards after reset

- Add Host section in login popup

- Change color buttons to open space by player deck rather than a popup.

- Allow for host to specify card amount

- Add a donâ€™t play button that comes up when you draw, can play, but choose not too.

- Player Card Amounts are a little delayed.

- On Game Reset players are sometimes given double cards

Sretch Goals:

- Add a chat functionality that also uses the popup notifications.

- Add leaderboard

- Add the ability to choose back of card image

- Add current games to login screen

- Record analytics
