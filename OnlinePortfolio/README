# Overview

This is a website that I created as a placeholder. People have been asking for examples of my websites and I wanted to make my website more profetional. I also wanted people to be able to contact me through the website. I added an email submission form to do this with javascript.

# Development Environment

I used javascript to create the backend of this website. I used Firebase to send the email from the website. The way that this is done is I updated the firebase database with information which is then used by a firebase extension to send the email.
