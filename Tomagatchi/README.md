# Overview
This is a Tomigotchi Game mixed with some Pokemon aspects. I wanted to learn how to use Typescript to improve my web development efficiency.

The purpose of this website is to entertain a user, I also wanted to learn how to make a webisite appear like it is running without the user by utilizing dates and local storage. 

It was also to learn Typescript. I have been programming websites for almost a year now and I have not used Typescript. I felt like Typescript would incease my productivity.
